*Below is an edited version of my internal About Me guide that I share. I recommend everyone on my team create and share it with their team to fast track getting to know eachother and volunteer information about how to best work with you. There's no perfect format, anything folks can share can help get the ball rolling. :)*

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Marcus - nice to meet you!

Languages: English, Swedish, so-so Spanish & Mandarin Chinese
Pronouns: He / him / his

I have been at Twilio Segment for 4 years, starting as a staff engineer. Now I lead Data Collection & Data Activation.

Previous to Segment I tried my hand at my own startup, built an [Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.com/m13labs-com-Tweet-Bot/dp/B0727V7DZW), worked at a [small startup](https://mixmax.com/), and spent 8 years at Salesforce (where I architected [Salesforce Topics](https://www.desynit.com/jennys-weekly-tips/salesforce-chatter-topics-whats-everyone-talking-about-jennys-weekly-tip-41/) -- backbone for collaboration tool in Chatter & Community Cloud). During my time at Salesforce, I did some short stints in Paris & Stockholm.

My parents are from Sweden so I grew up speaking Swedish and visiting Sweden very summer. I am teaching my two kiddos Swedish too!

## üõ†Ô∏è Work work work

### Schedule

My schedule is 9:00-5:00pst and sometimes getting on at 9pm when the kiddos have gone to sleep.

### Communication

I enjoy async communication. I have notifications turned off permanently on my Slack. When it‚Äôs late at night, I like to schedule emails / slack to be sent in the morning as opposed to messaging folks at night. If you see a slack arriving exactly at 8am that is why.

I am on [Manager Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) so feel free to ping me anytime and I‚Äôll prioritize appropriately.

You don‚Äôt need to schedule a meeting to have a Zoom/Slack call with me -- I‚Äôm totally fine with ad hoc calls. Based on my experience, 10 minutes Zoom call can be more productive than 30+ mins dialog in Slack üôÇ  ‚Äî If urgent, feel free to call or text me.

### Feedback

I‚Äôm not perfect and want to grow as a leader. I know, for example, I tend to be conflict averse.  If you see an opportunity for me to be 10% better even I‚Äôd love it! Appreciate direct and if possible specific feedback! A DM in Slack or can always hop on a call to discuss works great too. Thank you!

## üï∫üèº Outside of work

Mostly these days it‚Äôs just surviving the kids. If I‚Äôm healthy I‚Äôll play pickup ultimate frisbee once a week. Otherwise travel to visit my brother in Sonoma County or do a quick bicycle ride up Tilden park. Once a year I like to meet my high school friends and go someplace low-key to catch up and play basketball ‚Äî Boise was very nice.

Everything else I love‚Ä¶
- Skiing ‚Äî done a lot of downhill skiing, bit of off-piste, and a little telemarking. In a parallel life I would spend a lot more time on the slopes.
- Coffee ‚Äî I have lots of coffee devices and have roasted a fair bit of home roasting using a Popcorn Popper with advice from https://www.sweetmarias.com/
