One of my favorite past times is personal finance. And now that I have a little one, there is a whole new category of personal finance!

I've enjoyed sharing what I know with others one to one, so I'm happy to share more broadly. If you have more tips let me know [@mericsson](https://twitter.com/mericsson).

### 529 Account 

Some states allow you to deduct your contributions to a 529 against your income tax.  California is unfortunately not one of those. Still, being able to avoid being taxed on earnings on assets placed in a 529 account is advantageous.

Since California does not afford special status to 529 Accounts, you should look across the country to find the best provider for you. I found the [savingforcollege.com](https://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/which-is-the-best-529-plan-available) intro a good place to start. Ultimately, I chose the [New York State](https://www.nysaves.org) plan due to its access to low expense Vanguard funds. Here is the [saveingforcollege.com](https://www.savingforcollege.com/529-plans/new-york/new-york-529-college-savings-program-direct-plan/investment-options) entry for it.
